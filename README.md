# Escape room style mini game (Solo project)

This project is the final project for my first year of studies as a frontend developer. We were tasked with making an escape roomn styled game with 3 challenges to it. I created a level with 3 rooms and multiple items that interact with eachother. Some items on the scene are dependant of other items being collected already, and the final piece to escape the level requires multiple items to have been collected, changed, or found.

This was my first real project using React, and while I felt somewhat comfortable with props, I found it a challenge to know exactly what went where and when. Making the first scene I felt very happy to connect the array of name, description and use to the items I placed in the scene, setting up all the points and making them work took so long that I was forced to repeat myself again and again in the other scene components. 

I intended for the final scene to have more layers to it, but I ran out of time and had to throw in some logic to allow the final "winning" epilogue to play if you had certain items in your inventory. Some items went unused, and I didn't get a chance to fix the issue of the items respawning if you returned to a previously visited scene.

Learning the added layer of props usage for my next project will be my first challenge.
